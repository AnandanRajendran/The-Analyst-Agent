# The-Analyst-Agent
An automated AI News Analyst built with n8n and Google Gemini. Features include article de-duplication, 'hype filtering' via LLMs, and structured data extraction to Google Sheets.
AI Intern Challenge: The "Analyst" Agent (Option 2)📋 Task SelectionSelected Task: Option 2 - The "Analyst" Agent (Advanced Automation)I chose this task to demonstrate engineering depth in process automation, data pipeline architecture, and LLM integration. It focuses on the practical challenge of filtering noise ("hype") from real signal in data streams, a critical problem in modern AI applications.🚀 Project OverviewThis is an autonomous AI agent built with n8n that monitors news streams for "AI Startups." It performs real-time de-duplication, analyzes content using Google Gemini, filters out marketing "fluff," and saves structured insights into a database.Key FeaturesSmart De-Duplication: Filters out repetitive stories across different publishers to ensure a clean dataset."Hype" Filtration: Uses an LLM to semantically analyze articles and discard generic marketing content, keeping only substantial events (Funding, Product Launches, Partnerships).Structured Extraction: Converts unstructured news text into a strict JSON schema (Company, Sentiment Score, Category).Rate-Limit Handling: Implements a robust batching loop (1 item every 4 seconds) to respect API constraints without crashing.🛠️ Tech Stack & Architectural DecisionsComponentChoiceJustificationWorkflow Enginen8nChosen for its visual logic flow which allows for rapid handling of complex branching and looping (e.g., the "Hype Filter" logic) significantly faster than writing boilerplate Python scripts.LLMGemini 1.5 FlashSelected for its speed and efficiency. Flash is optimized for high-volume text processing tasks like this. It provides the necessary reasoning capability for sentiment analysis at a fraction of the latency (and cost) of GPT-4.Data SourceNewsAPIProvides a reliable, structured stream of global tech news with robust query parameters for filtering.ScriptingJavaScript (Native)While Python is a strong tool for data, I utilized n8n's native JavaScript runtime for JSON parsing. This minimizes execution latency by avoiding the overhead of spinning up isolated Python sandboxes for every single article processed.⚙️ How to Set Up and Run LocallyFollow these steps to get the agent running on your local machine.PrerequisitesNode.js (v16 or higher) OR Dockern8n installed locallyA Google Cloud Project (for Sheets API & Gemini)A NewsAPI KeyInstallation Steps1. Clone the Repositorygit clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_LINK]
cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
2. Start n8nYou can run n8n using npx (easiest) or Docker.# Method A: using npx (Node.js)
npx n8n

# Method B: using Docker
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n n8nio/n8n
Once running, open http://localhost:5678 in your browser.3. Import the WorkflowIn the n8n interface, click Workflows (top right menu) > Import from File.Select the workflow.json file included in this repository.4. Configure CredentialsFor security, API keys are not included in the code. You must enter your own:NewsAPI: Open the HTTP Request node. In "Query Parameters", enter your API Key.Google Gemini: Open the Google Gemini node. Create a new credential using your Google AI Studio Key.Google Sheets: Open the Google Sheets node. Create a credential using "Sign in with Google" (OAuth2) or a Service Account.5. Database SetupCreate a new Google Sheet.In the first row, add these exact headers: company_name, category, sentiment_score, summary, is_fluff.Update the Google Sheets node in n8n to point to your specific file.ExecutionClick the Execute Workflow button at the bottom of the canvas. The agent will begin fetching, filtering, and saving data in real-time.🧠 Logic MapThis diagram represents the decision flow implemented in the agent:Ingest: Fetch raw JSON from NewsAPI.Normalize: Split lists into individual items.Deduplicate: Check Title against incoming batch; drop duplicates.Loop: Process 1 item at a time (Rate Limit Protection).Analyze (LLM): Gemini extracts entities and determines is_fluff boolean.Gatekeeper:IF is_fluff == true → Discard.IF is_fluff == false → Save to Database.Throttle: Wait 4 seconds.Repeat: Continue loop.Submitted by [Your Name]
